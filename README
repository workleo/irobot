    This small application was based on Frank Robert Anderson's
article 'Basic Hello World with composer and php'.
    As an example of a third-party package, lifei6671 php-captcha
was taken. To use this package, you will need PHP-GD.
    So now you can check whether you are human or not. . .  :)

    P.S.  It starts in - src/index.php
